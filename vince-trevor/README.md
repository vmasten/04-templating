# Project Name

**Author**: Vince Masten and Trevor Stam
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Our task today was to refactor an existing site to use Handlebars.js as opposed to jQuery in order to render blog posts to the DOM. Most of the code was built for us, but we had to take existing objects and figure out how to build and feed them into a Handlebars template. We were also asked to refactor functions into arrow functions whenever possible.

## Getting Started
Download the repo and add it to the hosting server of your choice, being sure to preserve the directory structure. No other files are necessary for it to work.

## Architecture
Uses jQuery, Handlebars.js HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Libraries are CDN downloads.
